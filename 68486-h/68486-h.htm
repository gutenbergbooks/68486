art.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The artistic instincts of the peasant women find satisfaction largely in the working
of embroidery, each district having its own characteristic types of design.</i>
</p>
<p><i>One of Shevchenko’s favorite fancies was to compare his versification to the work
of the girls and women embroidering their designs on their garments. He frequently
speaks of himself as “embroidering verses.”</i>
</p>
<p><i>It is a favorite device of Ukrainian book-makers to decorate their pages with miniature
landscapes and little figures.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The frontispiece of the present work is a picture of Shevchenko in youth from an original
painted by himself. On page 129 we see him as he looked after his return from exile.</i>

<p class="first"><i>Nearly twenty years ago the translator of these poems was sent by the Presbyterian
church as a medical missionary to a newly settled district in Manitoba. A very large
proportion of the incoming settlers in this district were Ukrainians, indeed it was
largely owing to the interest taken in these newcomers that the writer was sent there.</i>
</p>
<p><i>It was Mr. John Bodrug who first, introduced him to the study of the poems of Shevchenko
and with his help translations of three or four of the poems were made a dozen years
ago. Press of other work prevented the following up of this study till last summer
when with the help of Mr. Sigmund Bychinsky translations were made of the other poems
here given, and considerable time spent in arriving at an understanding of the spirit
of the poems and the nature of the situations described. Then the more formidable
task was approached of trying to carry over not only the thought but something <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e541">[<a href="#xd31e541">10</a>]</span>of the style, spirit and music of the original into the English tongue.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The spirit of Shevchenko was too independent to suffer him to be much bound by narrow
rules of metre and rhyme. The translator has found the same attitude convenient, for
when the versification may be varied as desired it is much easier to preserve the
original thoughts intact.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The writer’s thanks are due for help and advice to Messrs. Arsenych, Woicenko, Rudachek,
Ferley, Sluzar and Stechyshyn and especially to Mrs. Bychinsky and for help with the
manuscript to Miss Sara Livingstone.</i>

</p>
<p><i>How many English-speaking people have heard of Taras Shevchenko?</i>
</p>
<p><i>What “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” did for the negroes of the United States of America the poems
of Shevchenko did for the serfs of Russia. They aroused the conscience of the Russian
people, and the persecutions suffered by the poet at the hands of the autocracy awakened
their sympathy.</i>
</p>
<p><i>It was two days after the death of Shevchenko that the czar’s ukase appeared granting
freedom to the serfs. Possibly the dying poet knew it was coming and died the happier
on that account.</i>
</p>
<p><i>But in still another way does this man’s figure stand out. In the country called the
Ukraine is a nation of between thirty and forty millions of people, having a language
of their own—the language in which these poems were composed.</i>
</p>
<p><i>This has been, as it were, a nation lost, buried alive one might say, beneath the
power of surrounding empires.</i>
</p>
<p><i>They have a terrible history of oppression, alternating with desperate revolts <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e583">[<a href="#xd31e583">12</a>]</span>against Polish and Muscovite tyranny.</i>
</p>
<p><i>In these poems speaks the struggling soul of a downtrodden people. To our western
folk, reared in happier surroundings there is a bitter tang about some of them, somewhat
like the taste of olives, to which one must grow accustomed. The Slavonic temperament,
too, is given to melancholy and seems to dwell congenially in an atmosphere misty
with tears. But he gravely misreads their literature who fails to perceive the grim
resolve beneath the sorrow.</i>
</p>
<p><i>In the struggle of the Ukrainians for freedom the spirit of this poet, who was born
a serf, remains ever their guiding star.</i>

growing stiff from much campaigning, he would bethink him of his sins and deeds of
blood.</i>
</p>
<p><i>These things weighing on his mind, he would decide to spend the remainder of his life
in a monastery, but before taking this irrevocable step, he would hold a time of high
revel with his old comrades. This poem pictures such an event.</i>

<p><i>Back somewhere in the middle distance of European history—when the Ukraine was under
Polish rule, though ever harrassed by the devastating raids of Turks and Tartars—there
developed bands of guerilla fighters in the wild border-land beyond the rapids of
the Dnieper.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Sometimes fighting against the Tartars, sometimes in alliance with them, they became
known by the name ‘Kazak,’ a word of uncertain origin.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Fierce banditti they were, many of them serfs who had run away from their Polish masters.
But they often developed great military power. At times the Poles succeeded in securing
numbers of them as fighters in their army, but when the tyranny of the Polish landlords
became intolerable the so-called “Registered Cossacks” would sometimes join with the
“Free Cossacks” of the “border land”—which is the meaning of the word “Ukraine,” and
exact terrible vengeance on the Poles.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The story of these warlike deeds of the Cossacks has the same significance to the
Ukrainian people that the tales of Wallace and Bruce have for Scotchmen.</i>

The Cossacks saved western Europe from the Tartar and Turkish invasions, by fighting
the invaders in the land of the barbarian. The poem describes one of these excursions
where the Cossacks animated by the desire of revenging themselves on the Turks and
freeing their brothers who were lying as captives in Turkish prisons, undertake a
perilous trip in small wooden boats over the stormy Black Sea to Skutari, open the
prisons, burn the city, and return home with rich spoils and their freed brethren.</i>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The little Taras was born a serf. His first memories are of a mother’s love, of the
kindness of an elder sister, and like a musical undertone to all his life—the consciousness
of the wonderful beauty of Nature.</i>
</p>
<p><i>But soon another power of hideous aspect laid its grasp on the childish soul. It was
the knowledge of slavery, a grim and horrible thing that was slowly but surely grinding
out the lives of his parents, and that would surely, later, reach out for his own.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Yet even the system of serfdom may allow a little happiness to a child, still too
young to work.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The little boy had been told that beyond the distant hills were iron pillars holding
up the sky. At five years of age he set out to find these pillars. Some teamsters
found him wandering on the steppe and brought him back to his home. But this incident
marked the character of the boy as an idealist and a dreamer.</i>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e1405">[<a href="#xd31e1405">37</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Then there was Grandfather John, the brave old man who, half a century before, had
fought in the ranks of the Haidemaki who so nearly broke the Polish power. On a Sunday
the wondering family would listen to the mighty voice ringing out in the little home—telling
of ancient battles for freedom.</i>
</p>
<p><i>When Taras was seven years of age he lost his mother. His father was left with six
children, and thought to improve matters by marrying a widow with three. Thereafter
the miseries increased for little Taras who was hated by his stepmother.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The father lived a few years longer, and to him Taras owed the knowledge of reading,
for though they were serfs and lived in a wretched hovel, the Shevchenko’s prided
themselves on having retained some elements of culture.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Our little hero, however, had a strange passion for drawing and painting and also
for singing, and found some employment among the drunken painters, and church-singers
of the village.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Later his master tried to make him work, but found the lad hopeless for anything but
his beloved painting. Finally, he reached Petrograd in the suite of his master’s son,
where he was apprenticed to a decorator.</i>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e1421">[<a href="#xd31e1421">38</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>A famous man came upon a ragged boy sitting on a pail, in the Royal Gardens, in the
moonlight, drawing a picture of a statue there. This was the beginning of a period
of good fortune. The lad was introduced to some of the great men of the capital. His
genius was recognized. A famous painter painted a picture that was raffled off for
sufficient money to purchase the boy’s freedom, and he was entered as a student in
the Academy.</i>

<p class="line">Thee, sweet son, shall strangers christen, </p>
<p class="line">Thy mother’s eyes with teardrops glisten. </p>

<p><i>This is the national poem of the Ukrainians, recited at all their gatherings. I have
given the thought and something of the feeling. The music of the original I could
not give. It begins like a Highland dirge with wailing amphibrachs, and there are
other measures in it not used in our language. Perhaps some future student may be
moved to put this poem in such English form as will give the true impression of the
original.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The motive of the poem is, in part, to awaken the conscience of the young educated
Ukrainians who, for the sake of gain were allowing themselves to be used as tools
by foreign oppressors.</i>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>In 1845 Shevchenko was graduated from the Imperial Academy of Arts at Petersburg.
Shortly after he travelled to the Ukraine, purposing to devote his life to the service
of his own people.</i>
</p>
<p><i>His progress was a triumphal march, a succession of banquets and popular welcomes
and entertainments at the homes of the wealthy.</i>
</p>
<p><i>At Kiev people still remember that the earliest Russian civilization had its beginnings
in the Ukraine. There Christianity first took root, and there were the first Russian
Princes.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Before Shevchenko’s arrival there was organized at Kiev the Society of Cyril and Methodius,
called after the great apostles of Russia, and the leading spirits of the Society
were professors in the University of Kiev.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Into this brilliant company Shevchenko was welcomed. Its leaders became his devoted
friends. A chair of painting in the University was to be established for him.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Most remarkable were the relations between Shevchenko and Professor Kulisch. <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e3554">[<a href="#xd31e3554">104</a>]</span>Kulisch was to be married to a great lady, a daughter of one of the nobles of the
country. The poet was invited to the wedding and the bride, in her enthusiasm, actually
kissed his hand. This was an astonishing act of condescension towards one who had
been a serf, but this lady, herself afterwards a famous authoress, cherished the memory
to her dying day.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Shevchenko’s saddest experience in the Ukraine was when he visited his native village
and found his brothers and sisters in serfdom. His dream was to earn enough money
to purchase their freedom, and afterwards to devote his life to the liberation of
the peasantry. The poem—“The Bondwoman’s Dream”—commemorates the poet’s meeting with
his favorite sister, Katherine, working as a slave.</i>
</p>
<p><i>His friends thought he should go to Italy to perfect himself in painting. Madame Kulisch
purposed to sell her family jewels to raise sufficient money to send Shevchenko to
that country. Her husband who was in the plot told Shevchenko that some wealthy person
had contributed the money but he must not ask for the donor’s name.</i>
</p>
<p><i>But on returning to Kiev from the Kulisch home a policeman put his hand on the shoulder
of the poet painter.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The bright dream was ended.</i>

all his heart. He hated liberal thought and detested the idea of educating the masses.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Tens of thousands of copies of the New Testament and the Psalter were burned by his
orders. He said such books were for the priests, not for the common people. Incidentally
it may be remarked that the priests had to teach what he wanted or lose their jobs.</i>
</p>
<p><i>To speak against his government, or even to criticize czars who reigned hundreds of
years before him was a crime.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The little band of dreamers who formed the Society of Cyril and Methodius actually
hoped to convert this autocrat, and secure his assistance in freeing the people. They
had visions of a free Confederation of Slavonic states, after the pattern of the United
States of America, but with the czar as head. But they sadly misjudged their man.</i>

<p><i>The government really wished to he lenient, if he would only be good and confess that
he had done wrong. But Shevchenko was not of those who are willing to admit that black
is white.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The gloomy autocracy now pronounces his doom—a sort of living death in Siberian barracks.
The czar added to the sentence, with his own hand, the proviso that he should not
be allowed either to write or to paint.</i>

<p class="first"><i>Now-a-days we have many discussions and searchings of heart over the question of prisons
and the purpose of punishment. I doubt if the autocracy suffered many qualms of conscience
in such matters. It was simply an affair of silencing a dangerous voice and disciplining
an unruly subject.</i>
</p>
<p><i>They were too humane to put him to death, they merely sought to crush his spirit.
But the Slav spirit is hard to crush. It may brood and smoulder long, but sometime
or other it will burst out in flames.</i>
</p>
<p><i>In the case of Shevchenko another influence may be seen at work. In his ragged youth,
when acting as assistant to a drunken church singer he gained at least one thing.
That was a familiarity with the Psalter and the Hebrew prophets. The deep religious
fire of the Hebrew seems fused with his own irrepressible native genius to form a
spirit that could not be subdued.</i>
</p>
<p><i>They tried to make a soldier of him but he could not or would not learn the tricks
of the soldier’s trade.</i>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e3991">[<a href="#xd31e3991">119</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>They forbade him to write but he wrote verses secretly and concealed them.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Occasionally a humane commander would relax the severity of the rules. One governor
allowed him as a hidden favor the reading of the Bible and Shakespeare.</i>
</p>
<p><i>At another time he was taken with a scientific expedition to the Sea of Aral, and
employed in the congenial task of painting the wild scenery of that part.</i>
</p>
<p><i>At other times again the severity would be redoubled and pen, ink and paper would
be forbidden. Through it all his love and sorrow for his native land increased. Only
the remembrance of Ukraine kept him alive.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Ten years of Siberia changed the gay young artist of bright eyes and abundant locks
to a gray-bearded, bald-headed old man on whom Death had set his seal.</i>
</p>
<p><i>But his spirit was still unconquered. At the end of his imprisonment he wrote the
“Goddess of Fame” and the “Hymn of the Nuns” to show it.</i>

</p>
<p><i>Shevchenko’s friends at once busied themselves with efforts for his release. Finally
amnesty was granted. Count Tolstoi, on receiving the news late at night, hastened
to waken his household and there was a family jubilation.</i>
</p>
<p><i>But the new autocrat, though somewhat benevolently inclined, was also a little bit
suspicious. The banished poet was a pretty dangerous character. He had even disturbed
the conscience of autocracy itself, hence he was only allowed to approach his home
country by degrees. Finally he was allowed to reside in Petrograd and later even in
Ukraine, welcomed everywhere by loving and pitying friends.</i>
</p>
<p><i>His wish for his old age was to inhabit a little cottage on the Dnieper’s banks. For
this purpose he purchased a piece of land on one of those hills so often referred
to in his poems.</i>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e4252">[<a href="#xd31e4252">128</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Death came too soon, however, but the property served as the site of his last resting
place. He died at Petrograd but in the spring his remains were carried the long distance
to his old home. A mourning people lined the way.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Only a couple of days after the poet’s death, appeared the ukase of the czar proclaiming
the abolition of serfdom. To the common people it seemed that their peasant poet,
by his songs and his sufferings, had been the prime cause of their new freedom.</i>
</p>
<p><i>No speeches were allowed at the interment on the hill above the Dnieper but there
were many people and many wreaths of flowers.</i>
</p>
<p><i>One wreath, deposited by a lady, expressed more than anything else the common feeling.
That wreath was a crown of thorns.</i>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
